## Standard Policies
The standard worflow for this Repository is [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).  All code work MUST be done in a feature/story/bug branch and once code work is done a pull request to `dev` must be submitted and peer reviewed.  All branches must include the Trello Feature/Bug/Story/Task number to ensure we can see how issues are handled if we need to research.
